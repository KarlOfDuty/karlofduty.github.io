                    <h2>Roles</h2>
                    <p>The most important mod you should be aware of is the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1215502383">Custom Roles Addon</a>. It adds some extra roles compared to the default experience. Here is a list of the roles we use:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="innocent">Innocent:</span> Normal average player, just try to survive and kill any traitors you find.</li>
                        <li><span class="detective">Detective:</span> An innocent player who everyone knows the role of. Has a DNA scanner that can be used on dead bodies and weapons and also has access to a detective shop by pressing 'C'.</li>
                        <li><span class="phantom">Phantom:</span> An innocent player who haunts the player who kills them. This creates dark smoke around the killer and if the killer is then killed themselves the phantom is revived.</li>
                        <li><span class="glitch">Glitch:</span> A normal innocent player except the traitors think the glitch is one of them.</li>
                        <li><span class="swapper">Swapper:</span> A player who can do no damage and can't take any environmental damage. Their goal is to trick someone into killing them as they then swap into the other player's body and take on that player's role.</li>
                        <li><span class="jester">Jester:</span> Sometimes the swapper instead spawns as the much more powerful jester. The jester also wants to trick others into killing them but when they die the entire round ends and the jester wins.</li>
                        <li><span class="traitor">Traitor:</span> The traitor's job is to kill all innocents before the round timer runs out. They are always outnumbered so will have to use tactics and stealth to reach their goals. To make things a bit more even they also have access to the traitor shop which can be used by pressing 'C'.</li>
                        <li><span class="assassin">Assassin:</span> A traitor who starts with a specific player as their target. The assassin deals double damage to their target and half damage to all other players. They will keep getting new targets until all innocents are dead or they kill someone who isn't their target.</li>
                        <li><span class="hypnotist">Hypnotist:</span> A traitor who can revive another dead player who then joins the traitor team.</li>
